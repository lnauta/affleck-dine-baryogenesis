# Baryon asymmetry generation using the Affleck-Dine dynamics 
### by Lodewijk Nauta

These are the notebooks I made during my master's thesis on the Affleck-Dine mechanism in 2012-2013. The full thesis can be found here: https://esc.fnwi.uva.nl/thesis/centraal/files/f1601531437.pdf
Most of the notebooks are cleaned up and combinations of almost 50 different notebooks made over the course of a year.
The notebooks use the conventional notation from theoretical cosmology, but some notebooks can feel a bit sloppy. All the .tex and other files have been excluded from this repository.

These notebooks can be used to calculate the baryon asymmetry parameter \eta (and more!) and there are some code blocks for generating figures and animations that show what is going on in the dynamics.
They are mostly on gauge mediated symmetry breaking (GMSB), but most of the (gravity) Planck mediated symmetry breaking (PMSB) functionality  can be recovered by removing the logarithmic term from the potential.
The PMSB code is not included since it needs too much work to clean up and prettify, and it's quite similar to the GMSB code.

Note: The code is not split up in .m files and notebooks. It was written on Mathematica 7 and 8, I can not guarantee that it works on the latest version of Mathematica. If you update the code just make a pull request.
